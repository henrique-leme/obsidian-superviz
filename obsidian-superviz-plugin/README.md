## Project Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è In Development

### Description

**Obsidian SuperViz Plugin** is a proof of concept (POC) for a real-time collaborative Markdown editor, seamlessly integrated into Obsidian. It allows multiple users to edit `.md` files simultaneously through a plugin that connects to a collaborative web interface. This project aims to facilitate real-time documentation, note-taking during meetings, and collaborative brainstorming directly within the Obsidian environment. The plugin was developed by **Henrique Leme** as a demonstration of the potential for combining **SuperViz** and **Yjs** technologies within Obsidian.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Utilizes **Yjs** for conflict-free real-time collaboration within Obsidian, allowing multiple users to work on the same Markdown document.
- **Presence Tracking**: Integration with **SuperViz** to track and display the real-time presence of collaborators, showing who is editing the document.
- **Video Conference Integration**: Allows users to initiate real-time **video conferencing** directly from the Obsidian plugin, enhancing communication during collaboration.
- **Session Recording**: Ability to record collaborative sessions for later reference, ensuring important discussions are preserved.
- **Transcriptions**: Post-session transcription generation to easily review and summarize meeting discussions.

### üìö Project Vision

The vision for this project is to evolve into a robust tool for teams to collaborate in real-time within Obsidian, streamlining the documentation process, enhancing meeting productivity, and fostering dynamic brainstorming sessions. Combining the synchronization capabilities of **Yjs** with the collaborative features of **SuperViz**, this plugin lays the foundation for a comprehensive real-time collaborative experience.
