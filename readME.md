## Project Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è In Development

### Description

**Obsidian SuperViz** is a proof of concept (POC) for a real-time collaborative Markdown editor, deeply inspired by the minimalist and dark aesthetic of Obsidian. Its primary goal is to enable seamless collaboration between multiple users who can simultaneously edit `.md` files, both through a modern web interface and an integrated plugin within Obsidian. Although not fully polished, the project is a functional prototype designed to facilitate real-time documentation, capture meeting notes, and collaboratively brainstorm and develop ideas in a dynamic and connected environment. The project was developed solely by **My Myself and I** in just **one day**, showcasing the rapid development process.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Powered by **Yjs** for conflict-free real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously.
- **Presence Tracking**: Integration with **SuperViz** to display real-time presence of users, showing who is editing the document and their exact position within the text.
- **Video Conference**: Real-time **video conferencing** integrated directly into the platform for enhanced communication during collaboration.
- **Video Conference Recording**: Sessions can be recorded for later reference, ensuring that no important details are lost.
- **Transcriptions**: After the video conference, users can generate **transcriptions** of the session, making it easy to review discussions and summarize key points.

### üìö Project Vision

Though still a POC, the vision behind this project is to create a robust, real-time collaborative editor that simplifies the documentation process for teams, facilitates more dynamic meeting notes, and enhances brainstorming sessions. By combining the real-time synchronization power of **Yjs** with the collaboration features of **SuperViz**, the project lays the groundwork for a future tool that can be widely used across various team workflows.
